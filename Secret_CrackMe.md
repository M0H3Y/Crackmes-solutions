# Level 
2

# Description

>Either you can get the secret(which might be challenging though), and the flag will be provided, or you can just manipulate the program to get the flag directly :).
Enjoy!

# Solution 
First, Let's open this executable in IDA and see how it works.

As we can see, there is some comparison made with my input, and if the result of this comparison is false, it will print `Secret is not valid. Try again.` otherwise, it will make a bunch of other comparisons. 

If we take a look at the function `sub_40177f`....it seems that it's the function that prints our flag but after making a lot of operatios on it.


So, we can bypass all those comparisons to get the function `sub_40177f` called and see what it prints.

So letâ€™s open up ollydbg and play around with the program to make it call that function at 40177f.
